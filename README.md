KARMO I research project was conducted during the last year of the KYT2014 research programme. It functioned as a preparatory pilot research for the later KARMO II (2015-2016) and KARMO III (2017-2018) research projects. The KARMO research continuum aims to develop a method to determine the mechanical properties of rock joints for numerical modelling purposes using laboratory scale replica series. KARMO I (2014) research project aimed to develop the photogrammetric method to record the rock join geometry, to digitize the rock joint into a printable mold, to print the molds and cast the concrete surface replicas and test the replicas and derive from the results how the components of the shear strength change with scale.

Research Topic

The mechanical properties of rock joints depend on the testing scale (Figure 1). Laboratory samples are 50…200 mm long and the naturally occurring joints may be up to tens of meters long. Natural, undisturbed rock joints are hard or impossible to test, so the goal is to develop a method how small scale joint replica shear tests can be used to derive the mechanical parameters of natural joints for numerical modelling. Modelling is used for example to estimate the displacement potential of rock mass in the spent nuclear fuel repositories. 
 
Research Methods

The research began with a literature survey on photogrammetry. The discovery of suitable parameters for the fast prototypers was done empirically starting from the simplest possible method and progressing iteratively towards the desired quality level. The point cloud was converted to a printable 3D model using photogrammetric mathematical software and programming. The concrete casting recipe and method were developed empirically. The shear box testing was carried out in the Rock Mechanics laboratory of Aalto University. The data was analyzed using stochastic methods.

Results

Subproject 1 – Replicating surface geometry using 3D technology

Two fast prototyper extrusion printers Printrbot Simple v4 and Ultimaker Original v3 were obtained. Raphaël Yorke assembled and tested the machines. The Bachelor’s Thesis studies the theoretical basis of the photogrammetric method using a literature survey and it describes the photogrammetric method developed during the research. The thesis contains an overview of the working principles of the fast prototypers and how they may be utilized as a part of the manufacturing process. A rock joint was captured and replicated into a printable 3D model.

Subproject 2 – Shear box testing of the surfaces and analysis of the results

Eero Korpi conducted his Bachelor’s Thesis research in 2012 about the Shear Box Test for Rock Joints. In spring 2014 he continued the research by obtaining and splitting a rock boulder and by piloting the 3D manufacturing method. The thesis describes the work from obtaining the large sample to testing the replicas in the laboratory. A survey to the latest rock joint research is presented, mechanisms how the scale effect works are described, sampling plan, digital post-processing and the manufacture into replica molds are presented. The study ends in analysis of the pilot test results, discussion and conclusions. Research assistants Antoni Kopaly and Daniil Iakovlev casted the research series and performed the shear box testing and documented the results for the third subproject.

Subproject 3 – Analysis of Scale Effect, Geometry and Asperity

Doctoral Student Ari Hartikainen developed an algorithm to transform the measured point cloud into a printable 3D replica mold. Doctoral Student Lauri Uotinen analyzed the preliminary results of subprojects 1 & 2. The results will be published in ISRM2015 congress 10.-13.5.2015 in Montréal, Canada.

The raw data from the replica series became available midway December 2014 and only two of the results are supporting the initial assumptions. The rest of the shear tests show no clear peak strength and the sample pairs compress vertically in the beginning of the tests. It seems that the observed behavior may be caused by too much imprecision with the matedness of the surfaces. The problem may be caused by the photogrammetric recording process, manufacturing process or it can be an error in the testing equipment or in the testing method. The issue will be resolved during the KARMO II continuation research in more detailed analyses. The most significant findings of KARMO I study will be reported as a scientific article entitled “A method to downscale joint surface roughness and to create replica series using 3D printed molds”.

Significance and Utilization of the Results

KARMO I research project demonstrated that the proposed photogrammetric replication process can produce surface replicas for the shear box test. The pilot tests and two tests from the main series are in line with the initial assumptions and produced the expected scale effect, but further studies are needed to increase the reliability of the proposed method. The initial results are most important for the KARMO II continuation study. The photogrammetric replication process is independent of the use purpose and it may be used to capture any surface geometry irrespective of size.

The results of the KARMO research continuum are published for researchers and officials, and they may be used to evaluate the suitability of different crack acceptance criterions or the acceptance of joint displacement analysis results. The majority of the results will be used as initial data for numerical modelling when analyzing the mechanical response or displacement of rock joints.
